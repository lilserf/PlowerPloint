Blaseball PowerPoint

- for each game, pick a presentation style
- for each at-bat, generate a slide
    - select from various layouts
    - select bad clipart based on the result of the play
    - play text and score ledger as bulleted items revealed one at a time
    - slide title as batter name etc
- for start/end of inning and batters coming up, use title/subtitle slides
- cheesy slide transition animations
- bonus if I record myself as if giving a presentation


TODO:
- solve /replay "end" issue
- emoji as an option for teams
- second style
- dropdown to choose which game
- team colors?
- add "battingTeam" so I can do "Now batting for the Steaks, ..."
- more clipart
    - home runs
    - multiples for Hit
        - or better/cooler for double/triple
    - double play
- slide types
    - game end
    - inning is now an outing (with current score)
        - "after 3 innings, the Foo lead 3-1"
        - "The score after 3: Foo 3, Bar 1"

Blaseball PowerPoint

- for each game, pick a presentation style
- for each at-bat, generate a slide
    - select from various layouts
    - select bad clipart based on the result of the play
    - play text and score ledger as bulleted items revealed one at a time
    - slide title as batter name etc
- for start/end of inning and batters coming up, use title/subtitle slides
- cheesy slide transition animations
- bonus if I record myself as if giving a presentation

Could use Tracery to construct the layouts?!
- YES let's try that
